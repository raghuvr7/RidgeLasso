## General Information
- Tthe US Based company Surprise Housing is planning to enter a new market geographically which is Australia. To maximize thier profits they utilize data analytics to decide what to buy based on the collected datapoints.

- Using Ridge and Lasso we decide which factors help them in predicting the price of the house and accuracy so that they can leverage the information to buy the houses in a new market.

- The dataset used for this is from the file train.csv
